/**
 * <p>
 * @note Question 1
 * Suppose your friend discovers a new algorithm and in his excitement tells you that his algorithm has a lower
 * bound of O(n2). Can you explain why your friend's statement makes no sense?
 *
 * <p>
 * Answer
 * Big O notation denotes an upper bound but is silent about the lower bound. Treat it like a cap on the worst
 * that can happen. So when someone says that an algorithm has a lower bound of O(n2) that translates into saying
 * the lower bound can at worst be quadratic in complexity. By definition, the lower bound is the best an algorithm
 * can perform. Combine the two statements and your friend is saying the algorithm he found in the best case can
 * perform in quadratic time or better. It can also perform in linear time or constant time, we just don't know.
 * So your friend is effectively not telling you anything about the lower bound on the performance of his new-found
 * algorithm.
 *
 * <p>
 * @note Question 2
 * Does O^(22n) equal O^(2n) ?
 *
 * <p>
 * @note Question 3
 * Give an example of an algorithm whose best case is equal to its worst case?
 * Counting Sort and Radix Sort are two algorithms which have the same best, worst and average case complexities.

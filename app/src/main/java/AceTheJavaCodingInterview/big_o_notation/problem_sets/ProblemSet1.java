         * Answer - No
         *
         * The algorithm represents insertion sort. However, the way the code is written, there’s no short-circuiting
         * for the nested loop when the values are already sorted so even in the best case, i.e. when the array is
         * sorted the inner loops run from the start of the array to the end. Unlike the implementation of insertion
         * sort in the lesson, the short-circuiting would never make the inner loop run when the input array is already
         * sorted. The best-case time would be linear and not quadratic. However, for the above snippet, the best case
         * would still be quadratic. The point to drive home is to exercise caution as slight implementation changes
         * can change complexities for the same algorithm.

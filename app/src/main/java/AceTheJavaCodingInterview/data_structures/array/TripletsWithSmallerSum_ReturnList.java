/**
 * TripletsWithSmallerSum_ReturnList Class
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * @question Problem Statement - Given an array arr of unsorted numbers and a target sum, count all
 *     triplets in it such that arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] < target where i, j, and k are three
 *     different indices. Write a function to return the count of such triplets.
 * @example Example 1:
 *     <p>Input: [-1, 0, 2, 3], target=3 Output: 2 Explanation: There are two triplets whose sum is
 *     less than the target: [-1, 0, 3], [-1, 0, 2]
 * @example Example 2:
 *     <p>Input: [-1, 4, 2, 1, 3], target=5 Output: 4 Explanation: There are four triplets whose sum
 *     is less than the target: [-1, 1, 4], [-1, 1, 3], [-1, 1, 2], [-1, 2, 3]
 * @note Solution - This problem follows the Two Pointers pattern and shares similarities with
 *     Triplet Sum to Zero ({@link
 *     AceTheJavaCodingInterview.data_structures.array.TripletSumToZero}). The only difference is
 *     that, in this problem, we need to find the triplets whose sum is less than the given target.
 *     To meet the condition i != j != k we need to make sure that each number is not used more than
 *     once.
 *     <p>Following a similar approach, first, we can sort the array and then iterate through it,
 *     taking one number at a time. Let’s say during our iteration we are at number ‘X’, so we need
 *     to find ‘Y’ and ‘Z’ such that X + Y + Z < target X+Y+Z<target . At this stage, our problem
 *     translates into finding a pair whose sum is less than target - X (as from the above equation
 *     Y + Z == target - X Y+Z==target−X ). We can use a similar approach as discussed in Triplet
 *     Sum to Zero.
 * @note Time Complexity - Sorting the array will take O(N * logN). The searchPair() will take O(N).
 *     So, overall searchTriplets() will take O(N * logN + N^2), which is asymptotically equivalent
 *     to O(N^2).
 * @note Space Complexity - The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) O(N) which is
 *     required for sorting if we are not using an in-place sorting algorithm.

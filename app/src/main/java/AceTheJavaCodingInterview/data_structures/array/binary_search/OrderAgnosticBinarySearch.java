 * @question Problem Statement - Given a sorted array of numbers, find if a given number ‘key’ is
 *     present in the array. Though we know that the array is sorted, we don’t know if it’s sorted
 *     in ascending or descending order. You should assume that the array can have duplicates.
 *     <p>Write a function to return the index of the ‘key’ if it is present in the array, otherwise
 *     return -1.
 * @note Solution - To make things simple, let’s first solve this problem assuming that the input
 *     array is sorted in ascending order. Here are the set of steps for Binary Search:
 *     <p>Let’s assume start is pointing to the first index and end is pointing to the last index of
 *     the input array (let’s call it arr).
 *     <p>This means: int start = 0; int end = arr.length - 1;
 *     <p>First, we will find the middle. middle = start + ((end - start) / 2)
 *     <p>Next, we will see if the ‘key’ is equal to the number at index middle. If it is equal we
 *     return middle as the required index. If ‘key’ is not equal to number at index middle, we have
 *     to check two things:
 *     <p>If (key < arr[middle]), then we can conclude that the key will be smaller than all the
 *     numbers after index middle as the array is sorted in the ascending order. Hence, we can
 *     reduce our search to end = mid - 1.
 *     <p>If (key > arr[middle]), then we can conclude that the key will be greater than all numbers
 *     before index middle as the array is sorted in the ascending order. Hence, we can reduce our
 *     search to start = mid + 1.
 *     <p>We will repeat steps 2-4 with new ranges of start to end. If at any time start becomes
 *     greater than end, this means that we can’t find the ‘key’ in the input array and we must
 *     return ‘-1’.
 *     <p>
 *     <p>If the array is sorted in the descending order, we have to update the step 4 above as:
 *     <p>If key > arr[middle], then we can conclude that the key will be greater than all numbers
 *     after index middle as the array is sorted in the descending order. Hence, we can reduce our
 *     search to end = mid - 1.
 *     <p>If key < arr[middle], then we can conclude that the key will be smaller than all the
 *     numbers before index middle as the array is sorted in the descending order. Hence, we can
 *     reduce our search to start = mid + 1.
 *     <p>Finally, how can we figure out the sort order of the input array? We can compare the
 *     numbers pointed out by start and end index to find the sort order. If arr[start] < arr[end],
 *     it means that the numbers are sorted in ascending order otherwise they are sorted in the
 *     descending order.
 *     <p>
 * @note Time complexity - Since, we are reducing the search range by half at every step, this means
 *     that the time complexity of our algorithm will be O(logN) where N is the total elements in
 *     the given array.
 *     <p>
 * @note Space complexity - The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).

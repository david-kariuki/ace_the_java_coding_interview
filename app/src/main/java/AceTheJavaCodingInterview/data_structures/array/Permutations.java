 * @question Problem Statement# Given a set of distinct numbers, find all of its permutations.
 *     <p>Permutation is defined as the re-arranging of the elements of the set.
 * @note Example, {1, 2, 3} has the following six permutations:
 *     <p>{1, 2, 3} {1, 3, 2} {2, 1, 3} {2, 3, 1} {3, 1, 2} {3, 2, 1}
 *     <p>If a set has n distinct elements it will have n! n! permutations.
 * @note Solution This problem follows the Subsets pattern ({@link
 *     AceTheJavaCodingInterview.data_structures.array.Subset}) and, we can follow a similar Breadth
 *     First Search (BFS) approach. However, unlike Subsets, every permutation must contain all the
 *     numbers.
 *     <p>Let’s take the example-1 mentioned above to generate all the permutations. Following a BFS
 *     approach, we will consider one number at a time:
 *     <p>1. If the given set is empty then we have only an empty permutation set: []
 *     <p>2. Let’s add the first element (1), the permutations will be: [1]
 *     <p>3. Let’s add the second element (3), the permutations will be: [3,1], [1,3]
 *     <p>4. Let’s add the third element (5), the permutations will be: [5,3, 1], [3,5,1], [3,1,5],
 *     [5,1,3], [1,5,3], [1,3,5]
 *     <p>
 *     <p>Let’s analyze the permutations in the 3rd and 4th steps. How can we generate permutations
 *     in the 4th step from the permutations of the 3rd step?
 *     <p>If we look closely, we will realize that when we add a new number (5), we take each
 *     permutation of the previous step and insert the new number in every position to generate the
 *     new permutations. For example, inserting 5 in different positions of [3,1] will give us the
 *     following permutations:
 *     <p>Inserting 5 before 3: [5,3,1]
 *     <p>Inserting 5 between 3 and 1: [3,5,1]
 *     <p>Inserting 5 after 1: [3,1,5]
 *     <p>
 * @note Time complexity - We know that there are a total of N! permutations of a set with N
 *     numbers. In the algorithm above, we are iterating through all of these permutations with the
 *     help of the two for loops. In each iteration, we go through all the current permutations to
 *     insert a new number in them. To insert a number into a permutation of size N will take O(N),
 *     which makes the overall time complexity of our algorithm O(N*N!).
 * @note Space complexity - All the additional space used by our algorithm is for the result list
 *     and the queue to store the intermediate permutations. If you see closely, at any time, we
 *     don’t have more than N! permutations between the result list and the queue. Therefore, the
 *     overall space complexity to store N! permutations each containing N elements will be O(N*N!).

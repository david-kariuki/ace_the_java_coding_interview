/**
 * SubsetsWithDuplicates Class
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * @question Problem Statement - Given a set of numbers that might contain duplicates, find all of
 *     its distinct subsets.
 * @note Solution - This problem follows the Subsets pattern and we can follow a similar Breadth
 *     First Search (BFS) approach. The only additional thing we need to do is handle duplicates.
 *     Since the given set can have duplicate numbers, if we follow the same approach discussed in
 *     Subsets, we will end up with duplicate subsets, which is not acceptable. To handle this, we
 *     will do two extra things:
 *     <p>Sort all numbers of the given set. This will ensure that all duplicate numbers are next to
 *     each other. Follow the same BFS approach but whenever we are about to process a duplicate
 *     (i.e., when the current and the previous numbers are same), instead of adding the current
 *     number (which is a duplicate) to all the existing subsets, only add it to the subsets which
 *     were created in the previous step.
 *     <p>
 * @note Example
 *     <p>Given set: [1, 5, 3, 3] Sorted set: [1, 3, 3, 5]
 *     <p>Start with an empty set: [[]]
 *     <p>Add the first number (1) to all the existing subsets to create new subsets: [[], [1]];
 *     <p>Add the second number (3) to all the existing subsets: [[], [1], [3], [1,3]].
 *     <p>The next number (3) is a duplicate. If we add it to all existing subsets we will get:
 *     <p>[[], [1], [3], [1,3], [3], [1,3], [3,3], [1,3,3]]
 *     <p>We got two duplicate subsets: [3], [1,3] Whereas we only needed the new subsets: [3,3],
 *     [1,3,3]
 *     <p>To handle this instead of adding (3) to all the existing subsets, we only add it to the
 *     new subsets which were created in the previous (3rd) step:
 *     <p>[[], [1], [3], [1,3], [3,3], [1,3,3]]
 *     <p>Finally, add the forth number (5) to all the existing subsets:
 *     <p>[[], [1], [3], [1,3], [3,3], [1,3,3], [5], [1,5], [3,5], [1,3, 5], [3, 3,5], [1,3,3,5]]
 *     <p>
 * @note Time complexity - Since, in each step, the number of subsets doubles (if not duplicate) as
 *     we add each element to all the existing subsets, therefore, we will have a total of O(2^N)
 *     subsets, where ‘N’ is the total number of elements in the input set. And since we construct a
 *     new subset from an existing set, therefore, the time complexity of the above algorithm will
 *     be O(N*2^N) O(N∗2 N ) .
 *     <p>Space complexity# All the additional space used by our algorithm is for the output list.
 *     Since, at most, we will have a total of O(2^N) subsets, and each subset can take up to O(N)
 *     space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm will be O(N*2^N).

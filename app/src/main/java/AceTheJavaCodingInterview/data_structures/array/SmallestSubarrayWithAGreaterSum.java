 * @question Problem Statement Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘S,’ find
 *     the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to ‘S’.
 *     Return 0 if no such subarray exists.
 *     <p>
 * @note Solution - This problem follows the Sliding Window pattern. In this problem, the sliding
 *     window size is not fixed. Here is how we will solve this problem:
 *     <p>First, we will add-up elements from the beginning of the array until their sum becomes
 *     greater than or equal to ‘S.’
 *     <p>These elements will constitute our sliding window. We are asked to find the smallest such
 *     window having a sum greater than or equal to ‘S.’ We will remember the length of this window
 *     as the smallest window so far.
 *     <p>After this, we will keep adding one element in the sliding window (i.e., slide the window
 *     ahead) in a stepwise fashion.
 *     <p>In each step, we will also try to shrink the window from the beginning. We will shrink the
 *     window until the window’s sum is smaller than ‘S’ again. This is needed as we intend to find
 *     the smallest window. This shrinking will also happen in multiple steps; in each step, we will
 *     do two things: - Check if the current window length is the smallest so far, and if so,
 *     remember its length. -Subtract the first element of the window from the running sum to shrink
 *     the sliding window.
 *     <p>
 * @note Time Complexity - The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) . The outer for
 *     loop runs for all elements, and the inner while loop processes each element only once;
 *     therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm will be O(N+N), which is asymptotically
 *     equivalent to O(N) .
 * @note Space Complexity - The algorithm runs in constant space O(1) .

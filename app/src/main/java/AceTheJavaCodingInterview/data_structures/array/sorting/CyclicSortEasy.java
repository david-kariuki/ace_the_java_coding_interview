/**
 * CyclicSortEasy Class
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * @question Problem Statement - We are given an array containing n objects. Each object, when
 *     created, was assigned a unique number from the range 1 to n based on their creation sequence.
 *     This means that the object with sequence number 3 was created just before the object with
 *     sequence number 4.
 *     <p>Write a function to sort the objects in-place on their creation sequence number in O(n)
 *     and without using any extra space. For simplicity, let’s assume we are passed an integer
 *     array containing only the sequence numbers, though each number is actually an object.
 *     <p>
 * @note Solution - As we know, the input array contains numbers from the range 1 to n. We can use
 *     this fact to devise an efficient way to sort the numbers. Since all numbers are unique, we
 *     can try placing each number at its correct place, i.e., placing 1 at index ‘0’, placing 2 at
 *     index ‘1’, and so on.
 *     <p>To place a number (or an object in general) at its correct index, we first need to find
 *     that number. If we first find a number and then place it at its correct place, it will take
 *     us O(N^2), which is not acceptable.
 *     <p>Instead, what if we iterate the array one number at a time, and if the current number we
 *     are iterating is not at the correct index, we swap it with the number at its correct index.
 *     This way, we will go through all numbers and place them at their correct indices, hence,
 *     sorting the whole array.
 *     <p>
 * @note Time complexity - The time complexity of the below algorithm is O(n). Although we are not
 *     incrementing the index i when swapping the numbers, this will result in more than n
 *     iterations of the loop, but in the worst-case scenario, the while loop will swap a total of
 *     n-1 numbers, and once a number is at its correct index, we will move on to the next number by
 *     incrementing i. So overall, our algorithm will take O(n) + O(n-1) which is asymptotically
 *     equivalent to O(n).
 *     <p>
 * @note Space complexity - The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
